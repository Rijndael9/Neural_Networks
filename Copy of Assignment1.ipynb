On CIFAR10, use 40000 to train and 10000 for validation. Then find the optimal number of neighbors by assessing the accuracy on the validation set. You do not need to repeat this experiment multiple times. Finally, compute the accuracy on the test set obtained with the best previously chosen number of neighbors. On MNIST you should get about 3% errors, while on CIFAR10 you should get about 70% errors. Why CIFAR10 is harder than MNIST? Pick a few mislabeled samples from the test dataset and plot them along with the correct ones. **Note:**\n","  * MNIST and CIFAR10 are much larger than the Iris dataset. A good implementation may need a few minutes depending on your runtime type. Please optimize your algorithm:\n","  * Compute the distances only once, then test for different values of k.\n","  * Use vectorized expressions to compute the distance. It is possible to compute all distances between the training and testing points in one expression. Hint: think about the vectorized expression \\begin{equation}(X - Y)^T (X - Y)\\end{equation}.\n","  * You can use single precision numbers in computation.\n","  * If your code is taking a long time to execute, please save its results before the lab session.\n","\n","**Note:** in NumPy, matrices have its own data type (dtype), which is retained during\n","calculations. Please pay attention to it. I particular, do not subtract values of data types not\n","having the sign bit, do not divide integers, etc. Results of such operations will not be\n","automatically casted to types having the required precision."]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"cGisJun363Kp","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":153},"outputId":"73e643e7-6b50-40a5-a34a-f1bb610fef4b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1540480892244,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":14824,"user":{"displayName":"Tina

hashing\n","\n","Problem 5 was about speeding up the inference using loops implicitly present in matrix multiplication instead of explicit loops in Python. In this problem, we will explore a strategy to truly reduce the total number of computations required to find nearest neighbors without sacrificing too much accuracy.\n","\n","To speed up nearest neighbor search we will employ *Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)* functions. For a given distance metric, the locality sensitive hash should put items that are similar into the same bucket. Notice that this is essentially a design choice opposite to traditional cryptographic hash functions that should amplify the difference of similar inputs (typically we want that small perturbations of data result in large changes to the hash value).\n","\n","One of the simplest implementations of LSH approximates the cosine distance. Let $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ and $y\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ be two vectors. Their cosine distance is defined as:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    d_\\text{cos}(x,y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\|x\\| \\|y\\|} = \\cos\\left(\\theta(x,y)\\right),\n","\\end{equation}\n","where $\\theta(x,y)$ is the unsigned angle between $x$ and $y$.\n","\n","We will construct a family $H$ of hash functions that are an LSH for angle distances (an approximation to cosine distance). Assume $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is a random vector (components are sampled from the normal distribution) of length 1. Then define the hash function $h(x) = \\text{sgn}(x\\cdot p)$, where $\\text{sgn()}$ is the sign function. It can be proven that:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","    p_{h\\in H}[h(x)=h(y)] = 1 - \\frac{\\theta(x,y)}{\\pi}.\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","The equation means that the probability of a hash collision grows as the the angle between two vectors gets smaller. Therefore, vectors that are close according to the cosine distance will be put with high probability into the same bin (we use the fact that for small $\\theta$ we can approximate $\\cos(\\theta) = 1 - \\theta/\\pi$.\n","\n","We will say that a family of randomly chosen hash functions $H$ is $(d_1, d_2, p_1, p_2)$-sensitive with respect to a distance metric $d$ if for any $x$ and $y$:\n","1. If $d(x,y) \\leq d_1$ then $p_{h\\in H}[h(x)=h(y)] \\geq p_1$.\n","2. If $d(x,y) \\geq d_2$ then $p_{h\\in H}[h(x)=h(y)] \\leq p_2$.\n","\n","For example, our family of randomly chosen hyperplanes is $(d_1, d_2, (1-d_1)/\\pi, (1-d_2)/\\pi)$-sensitive.\n","\n","Ideally, vectors should be placed into the same bin with a high probability if their distance is smaller than a threshold, and with a low probability if their distance is larger that the threshold. By combining hashing functions we can get closer to this ideal sensitivity.\n","\n","Given a family of hash functions $H$ with sensitivity $(d_1, d_3, p_1, p_2)$ we can construct a new family $H'$ by combining $r$ functions from $H$:\n","1. AND: let $h=[h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_r] \\in H'$ and $h(x)=h(y)$ if and only if $\\forall_i h_i(x)=h_i(y)$. Then $H'$ is $(d_1, d_2, (p_1)^r, (p_2)^r)$-sensitive.\n","2. OR: let $h=[h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_r] \\in H'$ and $h(x)=h(y)$ if and only if $\\exists_i h_i(x)=h_i(y)$. Then $H'$ is $(d_1, d_2, 1-(1-p_1)^r, 1-(1-p_2)^r)$-sensitive.\n","\n","AND makes all probabilities shrink, but properly choosing $r$ we can make the lower probability approach 0 while the higher does not.
